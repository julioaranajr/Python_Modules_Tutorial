## How to read this results

- `__builtins__`: This is a built-in module in Python.
- `__cached__`: This attribute is not cached.
- `__doc__`: This attribute does not have any documentation.
- `__file__`: This attribute points to the file where the module is located.
- `__loader__`: This attribute is a source file loader.
- `__name__`: This attribute is the main module.
- `__package__`: This attribute does not have a package.
- `__path__`: This attribute is not found.
- `__spec__`: This attribute does not have a specification.
- `module2`: This is a module from the package `package2`.

## How to use this information

You can use this information to understand the attributes of a module and how they are used in Python. This can help you to better understand the structure of a module and how to interact with it in your code.

## **\__builtins__**

This is a built-in module in Python that contains a number of built-in functions and variables that are always available in the global namespace. You can use these functions and variables without having to import them from a module.

## **\__cached__**

This attribute is not cached, which means that the module is not cached in memory. This can be useful if you want to reload the module every time it is imported, rather than using a cached version.

## **\__doc__**

This attribute does not have any documentation, which means that there is no documentation available for this module. You can add documentation to a module by using docstrings, which are strings that are enclosed in triple quotes at the beginning of a module.

## **\__file__**

This attribute points to the file where the module is located. This can be useful if you want to know the location of a module in your file system.

## **\__loader__**

This attribute is a source file loader, which is responsible for loading the module from the file system. The loader is used to import the module and make it available for use in your code.

## **\__name__**

This attribute is the main module, which is the module that is being executed. This can be useful if you want to know the name of the module that is currently running.

## **\__package__**

This attribute does not have a package, which means that the module is not part of a package. A package is a collection of modules that are organized into a directory structure.

## **\__path__**

This attribute is not found, which means that the module does not have a path. The path is the location of the module in the file system.

## **\__spec__**

This attribute does not have a specification, which means that there is no specification available for this module. A specification is a description of the module that includes information about its attributes and methods.

## **\__module2__**

This is a module from the package `package2`. This module contains a function called `farewell` that returns a farewell message. You can import this module and use the `farewell` function in your code.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about the attributes of a module in Python. We explored the built-in attributes of a module and how they can be used to interact with a module in your code. By understanding the attributes of a module, you can better understand how modules work in Python and how to use them in your code.
